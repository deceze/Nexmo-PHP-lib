Sending SMS via the Nexmo SMS gateway.


Quick Examples
--------------

1) Sending an SMS

    $sms = new NexmoMessage('account_key', 'account_secret');
    $sms->sendText( '+447234567890', 'MyApp', 'Hello world!' );



2) Recieving SMS

     $sms = new NexmoMessage('account_key', 'account_secret');
     if ($sms->inboundText()) {
         $sms->reply('You said: ' . $sms->text);
     }






Most Frequent Issues
--------------------

 Sending a message returns false.

    This is usually due to your webserver unable to send a request to
    Nexmo. Make sure the following are met:

    1) Either CURL is enabled for your PHP installation or the PHP
       option 'allow_url_fopen' is set to 1 (default).
    
    2) You have no firewalls blocking access to rest.nexmo.com/sms/json
       on port 443.



 Your message appears to have been sent but you do not recieve it.

    Run the example.php file included. This will show any errors that
    are returned from Nexmo.
